* oconnore:
** review article
** implement functional arrays -- use RRB-trees?
  http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/169879/files/RMTrees.pdf

* ebzzry:
** implement Red-Black trees?

* fare:
** collect any TODO item from the article that's missing in this file.
** fix expansion of :generic and :method so all generics are registered
 before the methods (and their with-interface) are expanded.

* Unassigned:
** Some bootstrapped datastructure from Okasaki
** More from
 http://planet.plt-scheme.org/display.ss?package=pfds.plt&owner=krhari
** Import functionality from cl-containers?
** Add "Minimal Viable Snippet" for the library and each of its major features.
*** Initial: some treesort ?
** test explicit <-> implicit adapters
** look at how scala does these things http://www.scala-lang.org/
** Move the payload of a tree out of the basic tree structure (i.e. (key, value))
** Add method to choose on which side of the tree to drop and/or insert,
 or document why the default is always right.
** Have stateful classes that allow for removing
 one and/or many entries while walking the structure once and/or many times (?)
** Add value merging as a method, i.e. generalize the map/2 mechanism to insert.
** Get something like cl-container's find-or-create-class, combined with memoization,
 for generating classes that match some specification of an interface.
** Note that a single interface may have many classes and subinterfaces,
 sometimes with mutual recursion in classes pointing to each other
 through methods and/or :class allocated slots.
** Develop example of multiply-indexed-organized tuple store.
 Each node is simultaneously node of multiple trees.
 Depending on which index you're using,
 they have to be viewed as a tree in the according way,
 and appropriate accessors have to be chosen for say subtree access.
 The same tree-manipulation routines can be used on the same tree nodes
 with completely different results depending on which interface you use.
** In classify, have an option to add a prefix or suffix to names of constructor methods,
 so normal methods can be part of an object-oriented protocol
 without a clash because of unsharable constructors.
** Add :pre and :post pure compositional analogues to :before and :after --
 preprocess arguments and post-process results.

* send mail to the maintainers of each and every datastructure library,
 and offer to merge into lil.

* Low Priority:
** Remember functions that were built with explicit->implicit adapter,
 and optimize away indirection through interface in any implicit->explicit transformation back.
** refactor transformers through a with-lambda-list-adapter
** Create a DSL so both pure and stateful variants
 can be extracted from a single specification,
 whereby you can (update-node a ...) and it will preserve
 the identity of linear variable a when in stateful mode.
